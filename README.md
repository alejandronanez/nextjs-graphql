# Next.js + Tailwind + Typescript template

Base project template using

- Next.js 10
- TailwindCSS 2
- Typescript

It is barely different from the [base project in the Next.js repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss) as it uses:

- Typescript's `baseUrl` and `paths`
- Has GoogleAnalytics configured
- Has Prettier
- Has .editorconfig

## Installation

```
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/alejandronanez/nextjs-tailwind --use-npm your-app-name
```
